      <p id="interesting-fact">Blue Dragons are sea slugs that float upside down by using the <strong>surface tension</strong> of the water to stay up, where they are carried along by the winds and ocean currents. They makes use of countershading: the blue side of their body faces upwards, blending in with the blue of the water. The silver/grey side of the sea slugs faces downwards, blending in with the sunlight reflecting on the ocean's surface when viewed facing upwards underwater.</p>

      <p id="summary">Blue Dragons feed on other pelagic creatures, including the Portuguese man o' war and other venomous siphonophores. This sea slug stores stinging nematocysts from the siphonophores within its own tissues as defence against predators. They reach about 3 centimeters in length at maturity, its back is silver grey and dark and pale blue ventrally. It has dark blue stripes on its head. It has a flat, tapering body and six appendages that branch out into rayed, finger-like horns.Humans handling the slug may receive a very painful and potentially dangerous sting.
